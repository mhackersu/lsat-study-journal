# Mastery

Like any high quality experiment, when we are working with an appropriately sized sample population, we are able to increase our odds of more closely predicting results. The principle of correlation seems to hold true, that studying for the LSAT would be akin to the sample principle; Whereby if we maximize the samples from the question bank, we would thus, maximize results.
